How to define bestness:

The Metric:
Crime Rates (lower is better)
Police Firearm Seizures (lower is better)
Police Incident Reports (lower is better)

We will define "bestness" as the "safety" of a neighborhood.
Lower Crime Rates does not imply safety, but it has a somewhat direct correlation
with it.
Similarly, firearm seizures don't imply less gun violence, but lower firearm seizures have
a somewhat direct correlation with lower gun violence.
Police incident reports would allow one to guage out the "true safety" of a neighborhood.

Procedure in determining the best neighborhood:

Within Each Individual Notebook:
Rank each neighborhood in each dataset based on the metrics.
	-Determine system and metrics for ranking
	-Perform Ranking (may need additional visualizations)
	-Visualize Ranking

Assign each neighborhood a mean score.
	-Take ranking of each neighborhood in set, sum, and divide by 3
	-Lowest Average is best
